# football_analysis
Data engineering project based on football using Computer Vision and Machine Learning.
In this project we are covering how an Object Detection Model works, in this case we are using YOLO. Also, we fine-tuned a version of YOLO to adapt our use case, learning the basis of model training.
Moreover, we use OpenCV to manage the video files and get the output we desired.
